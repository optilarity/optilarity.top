To achieve this "Super CMS" status, PrestoWorld uses a decoupled module system:

*   **Core Framework (`Witals`)**: Lightweight, high-performance base (RoadRunner/Swoole ready).
*   **Modules (`modules/`)**: Each vertical (e.g., `modules/real-estate`, `modules/lms`) is a self-contained package with its own Models, Controllers, Views, and Routes.
*   **Themes (`themes/`)**: Industry-specific designs that hook into modules.
*   **Bridge (`wp-bridge`)**: Compatibility layer allowing legacy WordPress plugins to exist alongside modern PrestoWorld modules.

## 🛠️ How to Start a New Vertical?

Developers can simply generate a new module:

```bash
# Example: Create a new Real Estate module
php witals make:module RealEstate
```
